%abstract = {Conoscopic holography is an incoherent holographic technique based on the properties of crystal optics. More precisely, for each point of the object, the interference pattern between the ordinary and the extraordinary rays is presented. The pattern is a Gabor-zone-lens pattern, with a scale parameter that is a function of the distance of the point. The superposition of the Gabor zone lens from each point of the object is the hologram, which contains information on the shape of the object through the scale-parameter dependence of each point is presented. I present a simplified version of the theory of conoscopic holography. The point-spread function and the transfer function of the conoscopic system are presented by using simple arguments, and the conoscopic hologram is defined. The basic schemes for reconstruction, i.e., retrieving, optically or numerically, this three-dimensional information about the object from the recorded hologram, are presented. Finally, the resolution of the system is quantified.}

%    Abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive theory of surface reconstruction from image derivatives in photometric stereo. For an object with an unknown, general isotropic BRDF, we show that just two measurements of the spatial and temporal image derivatives, under unknown light source positions on a circle, suffice to determine the surface.
%
%This result is the culmination of a series of fundamental observations. First, we discover a photometric invariant that relates image derivatives to the surface geometry, regardless of the form of isotropic BRDF. Next, we show that just two pairs of differential images from unknown light directions suffice to recover this surface information from the photometric invariant. This is shown to be equivalent to determining isocontours of constant magnitude of the surface gradient, as well as isocontours of constant depth, for the entire surface. Further, we prove that specification of the surface normal at a single point completely determines the surface depth from these isocontours.
%
%In addition, our theory also suggests practical algorithms that require additional initial or boundary information, but allow reconstruction of depth from lower order derivatives. The theoretical results of the paper are illustrated with examples on synthetic and real data.}

%and complete system for the diagnostics of catenary, both carrying out its
%original projects and evaluating the best experiences and experimentations
%done by the main railways in the world.
%This paper deals at first with the parameters to be measured to check
%the health conditions of every type of catenary according to the goals
%expected, not only to prevent faults and to plan maintenance, but also to
%examine the quality conditions through a guided analysis of the trends.
%For each parameter, the main reasons of measuring and the best
%situations of checking (speed, means and other conditions) are given,
%together with the tolerances admitted and the opportunities deriving from
%the analysis of the relevant trends in the space and/or the time, also
%automatically comparing subsequent and previous measures.
%Special considerations are given regarding the opportunities to
%measure at low or high speed and on the optimisation of using the data
%checked for different aims, such as the quality of the electrical feeding, the
%reliability of the geometrical setting and the quality of current collection.
%Furthermore, there are shown the main characteristics of a new
%integrated diagnostic system (Geocat) installed in a special trolley, able to
%do all the measurements running up to 100 km/h, with contact line alive.
%Among the parameters measured, particular considerations are given about
%the values and the trends of voltage, height, stagger, wear, forces and so on.
%The data measured are immediately used to prevent faults but are also
%post processed with a special software, to optimise planning maintenance
%and to calculate special quality indexes. In addition the trolley is equipped
%with cameras which record the contact line and the zone of interaction
%between catenary and pantograph, so the data measured can be compared
%with the relevant real configuration observed. With the optimised use of the proposed new automatic diagnostic
%system, at last are given the returns evaluated, in terms of productivity
%increasing, costs reduction and reliability improvement.}

%  abstract =     {The aim of this paper is to present an automatic,
%image-based system for catenary maintenance, a novel
%application of machine vision which has no equivalent
%today. This study focuses on the detection of droppers
%in catenary staves. The system takes benefit from the
%fact that dropper location inside catenary staves follows
%mounting rules, an information that is integrated into
%a top-down approach in order to speed up and make
%reliable the extraction of droppers. Results obtained on
%a large database of real images are very satisfying and
%enable for continuing investigations for dropper fault
%detection.}

%               object or the acquisition setup, avoiding any registration of independent measurements. To overcome
%               the resolution limitations of the individual projectors, we introduce a novel super-resolution
%               scheme. By exploiting high dynamic range imaging, we are able to handle even complicated objects,
%               exhibiting strong specularities. We show that, combined with an iterated bundle adjustment, these
%               improvements increase the accuracy of the obtained point cloud.},

%abstract = {The grating projection method with phase-shifting technique is very useful in measuring the 3-dimensional (3D) shape with high accuracy and speed. In this work, we have developed an ultra high-speed digital laser grating projection system using a high-power laser diode and a highsensitivity CMOS camera. With our system, the optical measurement required to find out the profile of a 3D object could be carried out within 2.6 ms, which is a significant (~10 times) improvement compared with those of the previous studies.},

%abstract = {Recently introduced DLP Discovery technology allows for tens of kHz binary image switching, which has great potential for superfast 3-D shape measurement. This paper presents a system that realizes 3-D shape measurement by using a DLP Discovery technology to switch binary structured patterns at very high frame rates. The sinusoidal fringe patterns are generated by properly defocusing the projector. Combining this approach with a phase-shifting method, we achieve an unprecedented rate for 3-D shape measurement: 667 Hz. This technology can be applied to numerous applications including medical science, biometrics, and entertainment.},

%abstract = {This paper presents a technique that reaches 3-D shape measurement speed beyond the digital-light-processing (DLP) projector's projection speed. In particular, a ``solid-state'' binary structured pattern is generated with each micro-mirror pixel always being at one status (ON or OFF). By this means, any time segment of projection can represent the whole signal, thus the exposure time can be shorter than the projection time. A sinusoidal fringe pattern is generated by properly defocusing a binary one, and the Fourier fringe analysis means is used for 3-D shape recovery. We have successfully reached 4,000 Hz rate (80 $\mu$s exposure time) 3-D shape measurement speed with an off-the-shelf DLP projector.},

In our system the constraint that codifies the pattern projected on the surface has been simplified by using a random speckle pattern, thus the correspondence problem is reduced to local matching between two captured images and solved by a spatial distance computation technique. The performance of our approach, which includes a disparity error analysis, a search range suggestion, and a disparity gradient limit, are investigated and discussed. Some parameters, such as percentile constraint, sampling interval, and subpixel compensation proper for use in this approach are suggested. Experiments have shown the feasibility of the proposed method.},

In both cases the spatially random patterns are seen by the sensor. Different spatially random patterns are generated at different planes. The patterns are highly random and not correlated. This low correlation between different patterns is used for both 3D mapping of objects and range finding.},

Its purpose is to generate structured light for a real-time photogrammetry stereo vision setup. As conventional digital light projector (DLP) projection setups are limited in their maximum projection rate to 250Hz for gray-value patterns, stripe projection systems are usually applied for real-time three-dimensional (3D) measurements. However, these techniques can only be used on steady surfaces as phase unwrapping has to be done. In contrast, the proposed setup is able to measure the shape of multiple spatially separated objects at once. We compare the speckle setup with a system using a DLP projector and with other fast 3D shape measurement setups, like the widely used stripe projection methods, qualitatively and quantitatively.},

We developed a double-exposure process based on holographic illumination of the object and the idea of the spatial carrier phase-shifting method to examine transient displacements. In our work, computer-generated holograms and a spatial light modulator were used to generate proper coherent illuminating masks. In this adjustment all phase-shifted states were at our disposal from one recorded speckle image for phase calculation. This technique can be used in the large scale of transient measurements. In this paper we illustrate the principle through several examples.},

First a self-adapting binarization is introduced to reduce the influence of inconsistent intensity. Then we apply local window-based correlation matching to get the initial disparity map. After the initialization, we formulate a progressive updating scheme to update the disparity estimation. There are two main steps in each round of updation. At first new reliable points are progressively selected based on three aspects of criterion including matching degree, confidence, and left\&\#x2013;right consistency; then prediction-based growing matching is adopted to recalculate the disparity map from the reliable points. Finally, the more accurate depth map can be obtained by subpixel interpolation and transformation. The experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness and low computational cost of our scheme.},
